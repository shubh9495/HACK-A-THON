Thus, the temple is known as the Dhari Devi Mandir.  According to the Priest, the appearance of the goddess changes with time, from a small girl to a woman to an old lady. Dhari mata is also considered as the guardian and the protector of a Char Dham in Uttarakhand. The temple has the upper half of the idol goddess Dhari Devi and the lower half is located in Kalimarth where she is worshipped as the kali avatar.

Situated in the foothills of the Garhwal Himalayan range located 115 km (71 mi) from New Tehri, the district headquarter, 60 km from the hill station of Mussoorie. Dhanaulti is a tehsil in Tehri Garhwal district, Uttarakhand, India.
Dhanaulti is located on the important tourist circuit of Landour,Mussoorie,Kanatal,Chamba and New Tehri. The town is densely enveloped by the velvety rhododendrons, deodar, and tall oak forests. Heavy snowfall during winters, attracts many tourists here.
Dhanaulti is still untouched by the maddening summer rush to hill stations, so it offers a holiday privacy that many seek. As Mussoorie has become overcrowded, many tourists prefer Dhanaulti. Dhanaulti is also an up and coming Honeymoon destination.[1]
